**My Research Intersets**: Deformable Object Manipulation (DOM), Aerial Robotics and Sensor Fusion

I am a **Robotics Researcher** with a strong focus on **robotic manipulation**, especially in **deformable object manipulation (DOM)** and **biomimetic systems**. I graduated in the **Robotics Program** at the [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) with the [RIRO Lab](https://rirolab.kaist.ac.kr/). 

My main interests are in the control of various robots such as manipulators and aerial robots using simulation-based methods such as reinforcement learning and traditional heuristic control techniques. 

I recived my **Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering** from [Pusan National University (PNU)](https://www.pusan.ac.kr/eng) in 2021, graduating *Summa Cum Laude*.

<!-- Moving forward, i aim to apply these methods to  .. ultimate my research goal -->
